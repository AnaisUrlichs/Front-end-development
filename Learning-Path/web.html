			<h2 id="Section1">My Why?</h2> 

			<div class="SideSpace">

				<h4>The short answer</h4>

					<p>I want to be able to enhance the usability of distributed systems!</p>

				<h4>The long answer</h4>

					<p>One step lead to the next. First, I became interested the information transfer and processing of data within oranisations. This lead me to study Information Systems Management at University. While managing a computer science club, I hoested several talks in the field of cybersecurity. This made me curious to explore information security, so I took several online courses in information security, learning about software vulnerabilities, attack vector of different systems, and cryptography. The latter fascinated me the most and it did not take long until I made the connection between cryptography and blockchain. <br> <br> At the moment I am working doing research in the field of distributed ledgers. My work mostly involves analysing projects, secondary research and creating educational conent. The main proble in the field of dlt is usability. Most blockchain applications require a large network effect to be usable and secure. However, blockchain developers are currently concerned with the backend design of effective blockchains. Once this is done, I want to participate in making all those fascinating applications usable.</p>
