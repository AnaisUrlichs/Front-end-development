# First Website

This repository has the HTML/CSS/JS files for some of the websites I built/will build.

While learning new skills I will update the repository, documenting my journey of becoming a front-end developer.

My learning path is based on the following [mined-map](https://coggle.it/diagram/WMMEvSoNyAABBX2w/t/web-development-in-2018/b97ca171d59ba2ab3b7ea8da244a8ed3a154ffa067568635fe2676068a1d44d0).
